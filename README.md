Hi all!
Please clone the 'development' branch on your local device and work from this branch.

Just a few things to take note of when using GITHUB (credit to Raymond for researching this and typing up the pointers below!):

1)    When the developper is ready to develop their features, he/she pulls the latest version of the develop branch from Github to his/her local machine.
2)    He/She then create a new branch and name it the feature he/she develops.
3)    He/She commits to that feature branch
4)    Once the feature is ready he/she pull again from github the latest copy of develop branch
5)    he/she then merge the feature branch with the develop branch in local
6)    he/she push the result back to the develop branch on github

Also, when pushing to GITHUB, please take care to only push the java source files you've worked on and not any class files/IDE config files. 

Thanks team!

Fayez
