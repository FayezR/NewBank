Hi all!

Just a few things to take note:
1. Please clone the 'development' branch on your local device and work from this branch.
2. When you'r3 ready to 'development' a feature, pull the latest version of the develop branch from Github to his/her local machine.
2)    He/She then create a new branch and name it the feature he/she develops.
3)    He/She commits to that feature branch
4)    Once the feature is ready he/she pull again from github the latest copy of develop branch
5)    he/she then merge the feature branch with the develop branch in local
6)    he/she push the result back to the develop branch on github
3.
